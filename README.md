# Introduction_to_Data_Science_with_Python

## Based on University of Michigan's coursera Intro to DS with Python course.

### Note: 
Repository only includes source files and solutions for Week 2 to Week 4 assignments; Week 1 was a quiz. You can easily find Week 2-3 solutions online. Week 4 is definitely more difficult for a Py beginner.

#### Hope this helps!
